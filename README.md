# Portfolio Repository

Welcome to the root of my portfolio repository. Here, you can explore all my projects showcasing my skills as a backend developer.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tai-MS/Portfolio.git
```
### 2. Navigate to a Project Folder
Move to the folder of the project you want to explore. For example:

```bash
cd "Full ECommerce API"
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
Once inside the project folder, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root with the following fields:

PORT=
MONGO_CONNECT= # MongoDB connection URL
SECRET_KEY=
ENVI=prod || dev # (Optional: Used by logger to determine if you're in a dev or production environment)
USERMAILER= # Email address used for sending automated emails
PASSMAILER= # Password for the email address
Each project folder contains a .env.example file that shows how to structure your .env file and provides more detailed instructions for each specific project.
